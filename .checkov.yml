# Use this to skip checks that incur high costs or break Free Tier eligibility
skip-check:
  # API-Gateway-specific skips
  - CKV_AWS_76 # Ensure API Gateway has Access Logging enabled (Avoids CloudWatch ingestion costs)
  - CKV_AWS_309 # Ensure API GatewayV2 routes specify an authorization type (Not necessary, replaced with IAM)
  - CKV_AWS_120 # Ensure API Gateway caching is enabled (not part of the Free Tier)
  - CKV_AWS_225 # Ensure API Gateway method setting caching is enabled (Avoid paid feature based on the hourly uptime of the cache node)
  - CKV2_AWS_51 # Ensure AWS API Gateway endpoints uses client certificate authentication (Avoid Complex and Costly)

  # Database-specific skips
  - CKV_AWS_28 # Ensure DynamoDB point in time recovery (backup) is enabled (Avoids ~$0.20 per GB / month.)
  - CKV_AWS_119 # Ensure DynamoDB Tables are encrypted using a KMS Customer Managed CMK (Avoids $1/month per key)

  # lambda-specific skips
  - CKV_AWS_117 # Ensure that AWS Lambda function is configured inside a VPC (Avoids ~$32/month (NAT Gateway))
  - CKV_AWS_115 # Ensure that AWS Lambda function is configured for function-level concurrent execution limit (Not relevant due to cost)
  - CKV_AWS_272 # Ensure AWS Lambda function is configured to validate code-signing (Complex setup, unnecessary for small projects)
  - CKV_AWS_173 # Check encryption settings for Lambda environmental variable (Avoids $1/mo KMS fee)

  # Cloudwatch-specific skips
  - CKV_AWS_158 # Ensure that CloudWatch Log Group is encrypted by KMS (Avoid KMS cost)
  - CKV_AWS_338 # Ensure CloudWatch log groups retains logs for at least 1 year (Not necessary and save cost)

  # WAF-specific skips
  - CKV2_AWS_29 # Ensure public API gateway are protected by WAF  (Avoid WAF costs ~$5/month per Web ACL + $1 per rule)

  # GitHub Action skips
  - CKV2_GHA_1 # Ensure top-level permissions are not set to write-all (Intentional skip as the workflows requires the permission)
